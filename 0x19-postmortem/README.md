We also implemented additional monitoring to detect potential hardware failures in the future.

Corrective and preventative measures: To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will implement a regular hardware maintenance schedule to detect and replace aging hardware before it fails. We will also update our disaster recovery plan to include procedures for handling server hardware failures.
